# PROG8300

Update: 2023-05-31
- New versions of images uploaded to dockerhub. These images are configured the same, but with the latest versions available.
    These versions have been tested, but not battle-proven.  Should you run into issues, either revert the 1.1 version back to 1.0
    or email Professor Steve.
- Notice the 'extra' IP field in the docker-compose file.  Some may wish to connect Owncloud to a 2nd IP, in the case of both bridged
    and host-only networking or through a NAT'ing firewall, this entry can be modified for that purpose.
